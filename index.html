            <img src="./projectImages/threeMusicians.jpg"></img>
            <p>At first glance it might look like a collage but Pablo Picasso's famous painting, Three Musicians is actually an oil painting. Completed in 1921, he painted two very similar paintings that are mutually referred to as Three Musicians and can be found in the New York MoMA and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p>

            <img src="./projectImages/Guernica.jpg"></img>
            <p>Inspired by the bombing of Guernica, Spain, during the Spanish Civil War, Pablo Picasso completed this most famous piece, Guernica, in 1937. This piece was originally commissioned by the Spanish government and intended to depict the suffering of war and ultimately stand as symbol for peace.</p>

            <img src="./projectImages/starryNights.jpg"></img> 
            <p>Vincent van Gogh has painted countless well-known pieces; however, his painting Starry Night is widely considered to be his magnum opus. Painted in 1889, the piece was done from memory and whimsically depicts the view from his room at the sanitarium he resided in at the time.</p>

            <img src="./projectImages/cafeTerraceatNight.jpg">
            <p>Never one for flashy titles, Cafe Terrace at Night (1888) by the ever-prolific Vincent Van Gogh, is one of the most individual depictions of such a mundane setting. Though Van Gogh never signed this piece, he references his famous Cafe masterpiece in many personal documents.</p>

            <img src="./projectImages/monaLisa.jpg">
            <p>Any list of Most Famous Paintings would be incomplete without the mention of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. This infamous portrait of Lisa del Giocondo was completed some time between 1503-1519 and currently on display at the Musee du Louvre in Paris.</p>

            <p>Using oil and pastel on cardboard, Edvard Munch painted his most famous piece, The Scream, circa 1893. Featuring a ghoulish figure that looks like the host from Tales from the Crypt, the backdrop of this expressionist painting is said to be Oslo, Norway.</p>

            <img src="./projectImages/girlWithAPearlEarings.jpg">
            <p>Considered by some to be the "Mona Lisa of the North," this enchanting painting by the Dutch artist, Johannes Vermeer, features exactly what the title infers - a Girl with a Peal Earring. Completed circa 1665, this piece can now be found in the Mauritshuis Gallery in the Hague.</p>

            <img src="./projectImages/thePersistenceofMemory.jpg">
            <p>Painted in 1931 by yet another Spanish artist, Salvador Dali's The Persistance of Memory is one of the most recognizable and individual pieces in art history. Depicting a dismal shoreline draped with melting clocks, it is thought that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity inspired this bizarre piece.</p>
